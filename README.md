## DataInterop

Code snippets for Python and R interoperability

- contains comparison of speed and syntax between [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [polars](https://www.pola.rs/)
- implement [parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files for speed and preseving data types

Will compare with R version of Polars once it is available.
